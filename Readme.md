# Porpoiise - my crazy Dolphin-based Wii U project

Porpoiise aims to run Wii games on Wii U without rebooting into vWii. Eventually, this will use the newer GX2 GPU, possibly allowing for rendering tricks previously available only with traditional emulators.

Development will be heavily based upon Dolphin's framework; as such, it's licensed as GPLv2+. This repo is currently just a clone of dolphin-emu/dolphin, but this wil lchange soon.
